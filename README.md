## Introduction

This project implements a cluster management system designed to handle data structures and algorithms (DSA) efficiently during a pandemic. The system ensures optimal resource allocation and management to maintain cluster health and performance.

## Features

- **Automated Resource Allocation**: Dynamically allocates resources based on current demand and cluster status.
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuously monitors the health of clusters and nodes, providing real-time status updates.
- **Scalability**: Supports scaling up or down based on predefined conditions and real-time data.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Ensures high availability and reliability through robust fault tolerance mechanisms.

## Installation

To install and set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/dharunm236/DSA-Cluster-management-Pandemic.git
    cd DSA-Cluster-management-Pandemic
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
    ```sh
    python3 -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the cluster management system, execute the following command:

```sh
python main.py
